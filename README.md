# Flask Random Forest Prediction API

This is a Flask web application that serves as an API for predicting outcomes using a pre-trained Random Forest model.
The application accepts user input via a web form and returns predictions along with their probabilities.

# Features

- User-friendly web interface for inputting data.
- Predicts outcomes based on user input using a Random Forest model.
- Returns prediction results along with the probability of the prediction.
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests.

# Technologies Used

- Python: Programming language used to build the application.
- Flask: Micro web framework for building the web application.
- Flask-CORS: Extension for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
- NumPy: Library for numerical computations.
- Pickle: Library for serializing and deserializing Python objects (used to load the model).
- Random Forest: Machine learning algorithm used for predictions.
